# ðŸŽ“ Univariate Analysis Using Python

This project demonstrates **univariate data visualization** using Python on the `StudentsPerformance.csv` dataset.

## ðŸ“„ Dataset Features
- **Categorical**: gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course
- **Continuous**: math score, reading score, writing score

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Performed

### Continuous Data Plots:
1. **Histogram** â€“ Math scores
2. **Box Plot** â€“ Writing scores
3. **Line Plot** â€“ Math score trend by student index
4. **Density Plot (KDE)** â€“ Reading scores
5. **Rug Plot** â€“ Math scores
6. **Strip Plot** â€“ Math score by gender
7. **Swarm Plot** â€“ Writing score by test prep course

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Save the dataset as `StudentsPerformance.csv`
2. Open the Python script or Jupyter notebook
3. Run each visualization cell to explore the data
